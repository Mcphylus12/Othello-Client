\summary{
	This document explains how to use the class file \texttt{cmpreport.cls} to write your reports.
	The class file has been designed to simplify your life; many things are done for you. As a consequence
	some commands presented here are specific to the class file whether they are new commands or customized versions
	of commonly known \LaTeX\ commands.
}

\acknowledgements{
	This section is used to acknowledge whoever's support and contribution.
	The command that introduces it is ignored in the project proposal, literature review and progress report. It is used in the
	final report,  but  is not compulsory. If you do not
	have an acknowledgements command in your preamble then there
	won't be any acknowledgement section in the document produced. \emph{Abstract} and \emph{Acknowledgements} sections should fit on the same page.

% If you do not want a list of figures and a list of tables
% to appear after the table of content then uncomment this line 
%
% Note that the class file contains code to avoid
% producing an empty list section (e.g list of figures) if the 
% list is empty (i.e. no figure in document).
%
% The command also prevents inserting a list of figures or tables 
% anywhere else in the document
%
% Some supervisors think that a report should not contain these
% lists. Please ask your supervisor's opinion.
